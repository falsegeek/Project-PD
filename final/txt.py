I like being a student. Each day I learn something new and communicate with my friends. We meet almost every day. Sometimes we stay at the university after classes to prepare our homework for the next day or just to talk about our student life.I like spending time with my friends. We often visit each other. I can talk with them for hours. They can help me and support me in any situation. I can say the same about my parents, with whom I live. My mother is a very wise woman. She understands me. We are not only close relatives, but also close friends. We have the same favourite colours — green and blue. These are the colours of nature and the sky. Our family hobby is travelling.

I am grateful to them for being so close to me, for their understanding and support. a well-known fact, that the geographical position very often influences the climate and weather of any country. The United States is no exception. Here, the Cascade Mountains and the Sierra Nevada Mountains, due to their being close to the west coast, catch the largest share of the rain off the Pacific Ocean. As a result there is too little rain for almost the whole western half of the Unites States, which lies in the of the mountains. In a great part of that territory farmers must depend on irrigation water from the snows or rains. One of the most important geographic boundaries in the United States is the 50-centimeter rainfall line. It ')

West of the line, you can find man-made irrigation systems, dry-farming and grazing. There are fewer people living here. West of the RockyMountains, there are vast areas without any trees. In this part of the country are the deserts which receive as little as over 12 centimeters of rainfall a year.
